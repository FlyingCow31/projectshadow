# Project Shadow

I didn't have any idea for the name so I wrote this. 
My first "serious" game, a hack'n'slash ! I want it to be in black and white, that's why it's named project shadow, and I want it to be cool with perks and boss fight. Still haven't decided if the terrain will be moving or if it'll be on only one screen.

*Note that they will not all appear during the first seconds of the game, They'll appear when the player is at a good level to not be one-shot by them. 


- [ ]  Hardcore mode with the player starting at 1HP, having all the mobs dealing 40% more damages and a whole new boss + some new loots

> Angels Wings: Let the player fly for a certain ammount of time

> Ultimate ability 1 - Berserk : increases the firerate by 60%, the movement rate by 80%, adds 40 HP, refills the mana and increases the jump height by 60%. lasts around 10 seconds
