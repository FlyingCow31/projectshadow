# Project Shadow

I didn't have any idea for the name so I wrote this. 
My first "serious" game, a hack'n'slash ! I want it to be in black and white, that's why it's named project shadow, and I want it to be cool with perks and boss fight. Still haven't decided if the terrain will be moving or if it'll be on only one screen.

## ‚úî To Do list


- [ ]  Add the first level 
- [x]  Add movements to the character
- [ ]  Add good movements to the character (including sliding, etc.)
- [ ]  Add a trail with the trail component and uncheck "emitting" to control it with the dash script
- [ ]  Well... add a character 
- [ ]  Add 3 types of monsters: 
> Worms : just worms, they annoy the player by jumping on him and slowing him, have like 10HP and deal 1 damage. 

> Skelettons : basic monsters, they are slow but they deal 5 dmg for 20HP. There are two types of skelettons: ranged one (with a bow) and melee one (bare bone hands)

> MiniDracos: Advanced monsters that fly and send fireballs, they have around 50HP I guess and deal between 30 - 40 damage. (and they don't take knockback damages).
*Note that they will not all appear during the first seconds of the game, They'll appear when the player is at a good level to not be one-shot by them. 
- [ ]  Hardcore mode with the player starting at 1HP, having all the mobs dealing 40% more damages and a whole new boss + some new loots 
- [ ]  Add a loot with, in the first official launch of the game: 
> 3 swords 

> 2 shields

> 2 armors 

> 1 heal potion (droppable on mobs)

> 1 mana potion (droppable on mobs)

- [ ]  Abilities for the hero, they are unlocked by either killing monsters or dropping them on future minibosses. I'm still deciding if the player can use them all or if he has to choose one.

> knockback spell : a chockwave that pushes all monsters away

> Laser spell: Send a laser that deals damages to monsters 

> Angels Wings: Let the player fly for a certain ammount of time

> Ultimate ability 1 - Berserk : increases the firerate by 60%, the movement rate by 80%, adds 40 HP, refills the mana and increases the jump height by 60%. lasts around 10 seconds

> Ultimate ability 2 - Samourai : Get a katana that adds 40 dmg to your own weapon, increases movement speed and jump height by 40%. You dash 40% further and when you dash, it hits the monsters.

- [ ]  A boss that'll appear every 50 waves or at a certain time, he takes the whole screen (kinda like Moon Lord in terraria) and has a lot of HP.

- [ ]  Score
